# Tatari Frontend Engineer Coding Exercise

This is a quick coding exercise that we give to our potential
hires.  It is intended to make sure people can write code and also
provides valuable insight into how they think about and solve problems.

## Timeboxing

We want to be respectful of your time, so any work on this should be
timeboxed to several hours, tops.

**Note: Please do _only_ the Frontend Engineer exercise. :)**

## Description

Write a program in Javascript that:

 * Consumes both `rotations.csv` and `spots.csv`
 * Calculates the cost per view by two dimensions:
   * CPV by creative
   * CPV by rotation by day
 * Format the results as depicted in the `mock.pdf`

Your solution should match the mock as closely as possible and
follow modern Javascript and CSS best practices.

## Details

First, this is intentionally a little underspecified.  Feel free to
ask questions, or to just make assumptions.  If you *do* make any
assumptions for the sake of expediency, document them so we know you
considered them!

For the purpose of this exercise, here's some terminology:

 * "Creative" - Business lingo for a TV ad
 * "Rotation" - The timerange on a TV network that an ad airs in

## Submission

When finished, please submit your solution as a ZIP file to the Greenhouse link we
provided in the coding exercise e-mail. Also, we politely ask that you do not post your solution
in a public repository. Thanks!

### Questions?

 If anything comes up, please don't hesitate to ask questions of your interviewer.
